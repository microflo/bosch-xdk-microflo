Rapid prototyping with [Bosch XDK](https://xdk.bosch-connectivity.com/) hardware and
[MicroFlo](https://microflo.org) for the firmware. MicroFlo lets one visually and live reprogram the device,
to quickly and easily implement on-edge logic.

## Status
**Experimental**

Note: The SDK for Bosch XDK does not come with C++ support out-of-the-box,
so we need to modify it a bit.

Note: Needs https://github.com/microflo/microflo/pull/175 to support live-programming

## TODO

* Write some useful/fun components for XDK
* Realize demo graph
