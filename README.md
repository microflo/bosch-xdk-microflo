Rapid prototyping with [Bosch XDK](https://xdk.bosch-connectivity.com/) hardware and
[MicroFlo](https://microflo.org) for the firmware. MicroFlo lets one visually and live reprogram the device,
to quickly and easily implement on-edge logic.

## Status
**Experimental**

Note: The SDK for Bosch XDK does not come with C++ support out-of-the-box,
so we need to modify it a bit.


## TODO

* Load microflo graphs+components
* Write some useful components for XDK
* Implement HostTransport, so can reprogram the device. Serial or MQTT
* Realize demo graph
